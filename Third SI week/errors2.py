# person = {}

# for prop in ["name", "surname", "age", "height", "weight"]:
#     person[prop] = input("Please enter your %s: " % prop)

# Now there is no unnecessary duplication. We can easily change the string that we use as a prompt, or add more code
# to execute for each property â€“ we will only have to edit the code in one place, not in five places. To add another
# property, all we have to do is add another name to the list.

# Exercise 7
# Modify the example above to include type conversion of the properties: age should be an integer, height and weight
# should be floats, and name and surname should be strings.
