# Write a Python program to convert a temperature given in degrees Fahrenheit to its equivalent in degrees Celsius.
# You can assume that T_c = (5/9) x(T_f - 32), where T_c is the temperature in °C and T_f is the temperature in °F.
# Your program should ask the user for an input value, and print the output. The input and output values should be
# floating-point numbers.
# What could make this program crash? What would we need to do to handle this situation more gracefully?
# T_f = float(input('Degrees Fahrenheit: '))
# T_c = (5/9)*(T_f - 32)
# print(T_c)
import math
print(float("8.8"))
print(round(8.8))
print(round(float("8.8")))
# convert to string:
print("%g" % 8.8)
print("%d" % 8)
print(float(8))
print(bool(8))
